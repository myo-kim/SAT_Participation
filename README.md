# Project 1 2017 & 2018 SAT and ACT scores 

### Problem Statement

With the new format of the SAT, the College board has seen a lack of participation across multiple regions of America as compared to the ACT. Specifically, the midwest and southern regions has seen low rates year over year. I will utilize the 2017 and 2018 SAT data to help strategize next steps for the College Board in order to increase market share in these regions.

### Datasets

The data set utilized were:

- [2017 SAT Scores](./data/sat_2017.csv)
- [2017 ACT Scores](./data/act_2017.csv)
- 2018 SAT Scores
- 2018 ACT Scores 

These data give average SAT and ACT scores by state, as well as participation rates, for the graduating class of 2017 and 2018.

### Executive Summary

In order to analyze the data, the first step was to merge all of the data sets to compare different metrics. To visualize the participation rates by region, I created a map of the US that was color coded by rate. Through this, it was easy to see that the midwest/southern areas had <5% participation on the SAT. From this region, Iowa stood out as the only mid west state with a participation rate that was not nearing 100%. 

Iowa currently does not require the ACT or the SAT. Instead, they have in place the ISASP. Perhaps students are opting to rely on just the ISASP rather than the ACT or SAT. In 2019 however, 3% of Iowa's high schools had graduation rates of under 67%. Additionally, 24% of Iowa high schools were seen as needing "targeted support and improvement" as a subgroup of the student population had scores as low as the lowest 5% of the state. 

As Iowa does not require the ACT or the SAT, it is understandable that their participation rates are considerably lower than their other midwest counterparts who do require at least one exam. Interestingly, from EDA it can be noted that Iowa's average total SAT scores ranked in the top 5 nationally. EDA helped to single out Iowa from the other states as a state with high opportunity to increase participation rates. The College Board can aim to target the remaining students who do not take either exam.

### Conclusion and Next Steps 

Going forward, it would be helpful to have additional information on student demographics, income levels, and individual test scores to conduct a more thorough analysis. It would also be interesting to see how easily accesible SAT prep courses were and how that correlates with test scores.

As students from varying income levels have different opportunities to education, it would be intersting to see how much income levels affected test participation rates in Iowa. 

Furthermore, as there is a negative correlation between participation rates and test scores, it would be beneficial to have additional data as to which students are driving the high test scores.
